currently i have implemented a basic nsfw detector for my blogging platform (only for text content)that uses extracting and storing content in a varible and count it to detect no. of inappropriate words in blog content. 
however, the filter is not robust always, so need to remove it and implement a better nsfw detection mechanism.

i found some free open source nsfw detection for detection of blog content whether it is nsfw or not.
they are:
1. Glin-Profanity : https://www.glincker.com/tools/glin-profanity
                    https://github.com/GLINCKER/glin-profanity

2. ProfanityAPI : https://www.profanity.dev/#api
    POST: https://vector.profanity.dev

need to integrate these both services into my blogging platform to improve the nsfw detection accuracy.

there are some components which are dependent on the older nsfw detection mechanism, so need to refactor those components as well to work with the new nsfw detection services.
