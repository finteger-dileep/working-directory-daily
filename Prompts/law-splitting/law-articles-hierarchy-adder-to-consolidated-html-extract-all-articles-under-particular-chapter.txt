Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
All article containers now have the correct chapter heading (`<h2>`) added inside their header, matching the hierarchy. The HTML is updated as you requested. Let me know if you need any further changes!

Made changes.

dileepkumar35: okay but why keep the chapter heading separately you can see that, delete the chapter headings outside the article container

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
All chapter headings outside the article containers have been removed. Now, chapter headings only appear inside each article's header as intended. The HTML is cleaner and more semantically correct. Let me know if you need anything else!

Made changes.

dileepkumar35: py script for copying each article tag container to each html file, the html files need to be outputed in the html folder, Each html files must be named from the value of the particular h1 tag value present inside the article>header tag

pls create a scrpt for this 

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/Dileep%20Kumar%20MR/Downloads/ksa-vat-splitted/split_articles.py)

A Python script named split_articles.py has been created. It will:

- Parse ksa-vat.html
- Extract each `<article>` tag
- Name each output HTML file using the value of the `<h1>` tag inside the article's header (e.g., "Article_1.html")
- Save each file in a new `html` folder

You can run this script after installing `beautifulsoup4` (if not already installed). Let me know if you want the command to run it or need further customization!

Made changes.

dileepkumar35: also not that the html str is this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>

<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width,initial-scale=1'>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='https://gtlcdn-eufeh8ffbvbvacgf.z03.azurefd.net/guide/stylesheets/dev/article.css'>
    <title>{here take the value of h1 tag for each article}</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div class='scope'>
     

        <main>

        // here each article comes

        </main>
            </div>
        </body>
        
        </html>

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The script has been updated. Each article will now be output as a standalone HTML file using the full HTML structure and stylesheet you specified, with the `<title>` set from the article's `<h1>` value.

You can now run the script and each file will match your required format. Let me know if you need anything else!

Made changes.

dileepkumar35: i need a py script for just copying the the json attribute from json file to another json file 
based on the condition of key 
#file:14-ksa-vat-country-law-articles-decisions-delta.json in this file you can see   "title": "Article 1",

and in #file:textOnly-content-file.json you can see "source": "Article 1.html", so this is the condition that match and paste the particular content and text only to #file:14-ksa-vat-country-law-articles-decisions-delta.json  article, need to do the same thing for all the articles

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/Dileep%20Kumar%20MR/Downloads/ksa-vat-splitted/merge_article_texts.py)

A script named merge_article_texts.py has been created. It will:

- Match each article in 14-ksa-vat-country-law-articles-decisions-delta.json by its `"title"` (e.g., "Article 1") to the `"source"` in `textOnly-content-file.json` (e.g., "Article 1.html").
- Copy the `"content"` and `"textOnly"` fields from the matched entry into the corresponding article.
- Output the merged result to `14-ksa-vat-country-law-articles-decisions-delta.merged.json`.

You can run this script directly. Let me know if you want the command to run it or need further customization!
