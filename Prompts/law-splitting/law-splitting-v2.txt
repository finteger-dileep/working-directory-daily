from this html list the chapters name and the particular articles under those chapter, write all those in this txt file: #file:hierarchy.txt 




need  simple but massive change:
1. change all the chapter, headings from h3 to h2 tag
2. change all the articles ,headings from h3 to h1 tag in each article container

---chapter h2 heading replicate for other Articles---
so based on the hierachy you have the information that under the chapter, these particular article come, i need to make on change that inside every article container, there are h1 tag and h2 tag 

wherever the h2 tag (chapter heading) is note there pls add h2 tag for that article the h2 tag should contain h2 tag
